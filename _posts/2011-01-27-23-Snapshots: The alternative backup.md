Copy on write vs. Write on new place.
 
Snapshot is a good thing, both in file system and database system.
 
If snapshot is quick and at almost no cost, we must get some penalty latter in other places.
 
Anyway, snapshot is good at the end-user's viewpoint.
 
Wish someday we can have beautiful, ease to use mgmt GUI for storage systems, file systems, database systems, and network systems. All at the same level as comsumer appliances - just like Apple iPad, iPhone?
